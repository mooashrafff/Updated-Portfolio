Static portfolios are outdated. That's why I built **New-Portfolio** ‚Äî a next-generation, interactive space that reflects my skills, projects, and journey in tech.

Instead of endless scrolling, this portfolio adapts to you. Ask, explore, and interact ‚Äî it's a conversation tailored to your curiosity.
